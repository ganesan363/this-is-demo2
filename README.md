"# this-is-demo" 


This repository is created for giving demo on git & github.

Things i did for making this repository

+ created a empty repository `animated doodle` in [github](https://github.com/new).
+ copied the contents from the page titled `create a new repository on the command line` and the lines are 
```
echo "# this-is-demo" >> README.md
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/ganeshskywalker/this-is-demo.git
git push -u origin main
```
+ i have the created an empty folder in my file explorer and opened the folder in CMD.After opened CMD i just copy pasted and executed the lines one by one.
 + the first line `echo "# this-is-demo" >> README.md` created an README.md file with the cntent `"# animated-doodle"`.
